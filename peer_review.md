Peer Review on: [ml_regression_jballard.ipynb](https://github.com/JBtallgrass/ml_regression_jballard/blob/main/ml_regression_jballard.ipynb)

### Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
- Exceptional job with organization! The readme is very easy to read, giving a quick guide and overview of the project. Even if I had 0 experience on GitHub, I would know how to access and review Jason's project. 
- I'm adding one specific readme feature to my project based on Jason's: the table that outlines each of the 3 models, R^2 score, MAE and RMSE. Having that so clean and accessible helps bring the project purpose together. I also like the quick introduction, almost like a linkedin profile intro. Very professional!
-  The only issue I found was a broken link under "Dataset Used" section in the readme, and the section is duplicated further down.
-  The actual notebook is very easy to follow. Super clean and organized, sections are headed well.

### Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
- Yes, I think all the features chosen (['age', 'bmi', 'children', 'sex', 'smoker', 'region', 'bmi_smoker', 'age_group']) seem logical for predicting charges. 
- Jason went further and validated feature importance using a Decision Tree, which supports the validity of his choices. 
- He also feature engineered bmi_smoker and age_group to increase efficacy of his analysis, which I thought was a saavy choice. 

### Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
- Yes, not only are the results clear but the heavy emphasis on visualization carries Jason's analysis to the next level.
- The pipelines and model usage struck an excellent balance between simplicity and robustness.

### Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
- Absolutely! It is clear that Jason fully examined the data and understood it from an analytical perspective as well as from a big-picture contextual perspective. If I were to fork this project, I would be able to immediately start on further analyses based on the insights provided.
