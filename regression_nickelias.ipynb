    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on predicting housing prices (SalePrice) using machine learning techniques applied to a real estate dataset \"train.csv\", found at [Kaggle Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal is to build accurate regression models through effective data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. This analysis could be applied to the \"test.csv\" dataset for Kaggle competition entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features selected for their strong correlation with housing prices include:\n",
    "- `GrLivArea` (Above ground living area)\n",
    "- `HouseAge` (Age of the house)\n",
    "- `OverallQual` (Overall quality score)\n",
    "\n",
    "Three modeling pipelines were developed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Pipeline**  \n",
    "   - Applies standard scaling  \n",
    "   - Uses linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pipeline with Imputation**  \n",
    "   - Adds missing value imputation  \n",
    "   - Enhances robustness and data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Polynomial Pipeline**  \n",
    "   - Incorporates polynomial features (e.g., degree 3)  \n",
    "   - Captures non-linear relationships in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance was assessed using:\n",
    "- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)\n",
    "- **RÂ²** (Coefficient of Determination)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional techniques included:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation** for measuring generalization across different data splits\n",
    "- **Learning curves** to evaluate overfitting and underfitting tendencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Performing Model\n",
    "The **Advanced Polynomial Pipeline** delivered the strongest performance, demonstrating the value of:\n",
    "- Feature scaling\n",
    "- Non-linear feature expansion\n",
    "- Thorough preprocessing"

    "This Regression analysis attempted to predict housing prices from the train.csv dataset by utilizing three specific attributes: GrLivArea ( Above ground living area sqft), HouseAge (current year 2025 - yearbuilt), and OverallQual (Rating of the overall material and finish of the house).\n",

    "These attributes were chosen because they seemed to have strong potential for correlation with SalePrice, had no Null values in the dataset, and did not overlap significantly based on a correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried applying the linear regression model with various combinations of the three attributes using a for loop method to iterate through all possible combinations (GrLivArea only, GrLivArea + HouseAge, all 3, etc.). I found that the combination with the highest R^2 score used all 3 attributes as the input features to predict the target variable SalePrice. This method yielded R^2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 33146, which means my model explained about 78% of the variablity in SalePrice based on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I updated the pipeline to impute missing values with the mean for numerical features and the most common value for categorical features (although this yielded no changes since my train and test samples had 0 missing values).\n",

    "Finally, I added polynomial features with degree 3, which helped capture some of the non-linear relationships within the data. This strengthened the model to R^2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 31614. This can be considered a very good predicting model in the context of housing market analysis."

    "One challenge was feature choice, since there are a total of 81 possible features (columns) in the dataset. The possibilities are nearly endless for the different kinds of analysis that can be performed. I decided to stick with the 3 features GrLivArea, HouseAge, and OverallQual because they seem to be obviously logical considerations when house shopping. I also explored a few other categorical nominal features GarageType, Neighborhood, and MSSubClass as they would be my first choices in Classification analysis through the Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge was working with the YearBuilt attribute. I decided to feature engineer it into HouseAge to make it easier to interpret (as the HouseAge increases, the house is older. It also grounds the variable to 0, whereas keeping YearBuilt would mean that the starting value would be in the 1880s.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I also had the challenge of deciding how to handle outliers. There were clearly-visible outlier values within the GrLivArea input feature, as well as the SalePrice target variable. Ultimately, I decided to filter out these outlier values from those variables since they would unfairly skew the linear regression in a way that would be unrepresentative of the majority of the dataset. With that in mind, it should be stated that my analysis was configured for housing prices under $500k, so it may struggle to accurately predict very expensive housing prices."

It clicked for me that they are similar to writing functions in Python; a data pipeline can be used again and again as new data comes in, so that we can prepare it for analysis.
