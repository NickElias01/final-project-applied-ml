# Housing Price Predictor


Include a professional README.md that introduces your project. Include:

a clickable link to your notebook file.
a clickable link to your your peer review Markdown file.
Instructions on how to set up your virtual environment and run your notebook locally.


Assignment Requirements
Your Jupyter Notebook must follow a structured format with clearly numbered second-level headings and reflection remarks after each section.

Start your notebook professionally with:

a single top-level title
your name (or alias)
the date
a brief introduction that describes the problem and the dataset.
Import the external Python libraries used (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn).











## Overview  
This project analyzes the **UCI Machine Learning Repository's Mushroom Dataset** to classify mushrooms as **edible or poisonous** using machine learning techniques. The analysis highlights the importance of **feature selection** and **model validation** in classification tasks.  

## Key Features  
- **Binary classification** (edible vs. poisonous mushrooms)  
- **Feature analysis and selection**  
- **Random Forest and Decision Tree models**  
- **Cross-validation and performance metrics**  
- **One-hot encoding implementation**  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **scikit-learn**  
- **pandas**  
- **matplotlib**  
- **seaborn**  

## Key Findings  
- Achieved initial **100% accuracy** with strong predictors  
- Cross-validation scores ranged from **81.59% to 100%**  
- Weaker features resulted in **86.83% accuracy**  
- **Feature selection** dramatically impacts model performance
